Another Topic for us is to create a safe environment for Crypto-Newbies to explore the many possibilities Blockchain can offer without them to have to worry about scam or the entry barrier into blockchain. We do this by implementing gamification in our infrastructure to incentivize users to explore features and content creators while providing feedback.</p><p>Core features:</p><ul class='list-disc list-inside'><li>Integrated monetization (reward system) for creators and consumers</li><li>Staking-based subscription model</li><li>Creator NFTs to sell different content rights at different content stages</li><li>NFT Marketplace</li><li>Dual reward system to make it possible for creators to submit their own tokens as rewards</li><li>Creator Ranking System to incentivize the discovery of newcomers</li><li>Quest-System to incentivize the discovery further and help crypto newbies get a hang of web3 features</li><li>Entertainment Platforms like Talkaboat, our Podcast Platform</li></ul><p class='my-[12px]'>The first product of Aboat Entertainment is a podcast platform called Talkaboat, which is in development for more than a year now.
