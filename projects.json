Through a seamless, unified cross-border shopping system that brings together all of the key E-commerce industry players in one location, our development team has been working to alter the perception of the global e-commerce market.</p><p class='my-[12px]'>Our most significant recent accomplishments include building a shopping to-earn platform on top of our cross-border e-commerce platform already in place, focusing on more upscale brands and products, and integrating nextgeneration blockchain technology, decentralized finance (DeFi), cryptocurrency payments, and tokenized incentives into our traditional package of e-commerce solution.</p><p class='my-[12px]'>Unlike other platforms, Shopdi will be organized differently, featuring a cross-border e-commerce platform that is fully socially integrated, supplemented by shopper-centric incentive design and improved postpurchase experience. Shopdi is the first e-commerce platform for high-end, high-value product companies where customers can set their own prices. By utilizing the &quot;Hidden Price&quot; and &quot;Unlimited Discount&quot; mechanisms, Shopdi enables Buyers to choose the product&#39;s price without compromising the Sellers&#39; ability to make a profit and establish their brand.</p><p class='my-[12px]'>In addition to conventional payment methods, we introduce SHOD tokens to Shopdi ecosystem, as well as alternative cryptocurrency payment options to bring cutting-edge user experience as well as new benefits to social shoppers and crypto users. The SHOD tokens can be used for loyalty and activeness rewards, discounts, platform governance, and other usages.</p><p class='my-[12px]'>Sooner or later, crypto users will be able to experience shopping mining, cashback, and expedited delivery without having to open accounts or convert their digital assets into actual money. This will include major e-commerce marketplaces that take cryptocurrency as payment. With Shopdi, we will create a socially engaging ecosystem of users, micro-influencers, high-profile figures, reputable luxury companies, and service providers who share the same interests and advantage.</p><p class='my-[12px]'>Regarding the creation and development of Shopdi, we want to brighten the future of online shopping toward crypto-commerce and eventually turn it into a SocialFi Commerce Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). We develop a unique decentralized business<br/>model that rewards platform users fairly and promotes community purchasing from consumers all over the world while boosting the token&#39;s liquidity. Holders of tokens will act as our supporters and evangelists, building a worldwide community that can maintain itself over time and continue to expand. Buyers, sellers, and customers will all contribute significantly to the development and improvement of Shopdi as well as the expansion of the business.</p><p class='my-[12px]'>Shopdi is also built on KardiaChain with a tight partnership to further its ecosystem.</p><p class='my-[12px]'>For more information about our project, you can visit:&nbsp;<a href='https://shopdi.io/'>https://shopdi.io/</a></p><p class='my-[12px]'>Token Name: SHOD</p><ul class='list-disc list-inside'><li>Chain: KRC20</li><li>Token Standard: KRC-20</li><li>Total supply: 500,000,000</li><li>Initial Market Cap: $56,000</li><li>For more information about our Tokennomic, you can visit:&nbsp;<a href='https://shopdi.io/#shopdi-tokenomics'>https://shopdi.io/#shopdi-tokenomics</a></li></ul>",
